## Part 1:
• DOMAIN: Botanical research

• CONTEXT: University X is currently undergoing some research involving understanding the characteristics of
plant and plant seedlings at various stages of growth. They already have have invested on curating sample
images. They require an automation which can create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a
photo

• DATA DESCRIPTION: The dataset comprises of images from 12 plant species. Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/
plant-seedlings-classification/data

• PROJECT OBJECTIVE: University’s management require an automation which can create a classifier capable of
determining a plant's species from a photo

## Part 2:
• DOMAIN: Automobile

• CONTEXT: A brand research company wants to understand which cars or car manufacturers are popular in a
certain area of the city or locality. Company has a team which takes pictures of the cars randomly through the
day. Using this the company wants to set up an automation which can classify the make of the car once the
picture has been given as an input.

• TASK: Help to build the image dataset to be used by the AI team to build an image classifier data. Import and
display the images in python against their labels. Comment on the challenges faced during this task.

## Part 3:
• DOMAIN: Botanical research

• CONTEXT: University X is currently undergoing some research involving understanding the characteristics of
flowers. They already have have invested on curating sample images. They require an automation which can
create a classifier capable of determining a flower’s species from a photo

• DATA DESCRIPTION: The dataset comprises of images from 17 plant species. It can be downloaded from
TensorFlow [ Hint: import tflearn.datasets.oxflower17 as oxflower17 ]

• PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Company’s management requires an automation which can create a classifier capable of
determining a flower’s species from a photo
